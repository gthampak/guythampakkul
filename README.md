### Evaluation and Optimization of Traffic Control using Original Software [[github]](https://github.com/gthampak/BangkokTrafficRaise2021) *(Summer 2021 - Present)*
- Started as a Pomona funded RAISE (Remote Alternative Independent Summer Experience) project, but turned into more.
- Programmed traffic simulator and optimizer in Java using graph theory. Software can currently run a bug-free complete graphical road network with cars displayed in ASCII in the console with moderate simulation interactions.
- Mostly worked on this project during the summer of 2021. However, I remain incredibly excited about this project and would come and work on it and add research questions to test with the program from time to time. This project is one I use to learn new things and continue to use it to learn new languages and interfaces.
- Worked with and interviewed Thai (traffic) police officers, Thai ministry of transportation, Bangkok Traffic and Transportation Department.
- Use Victory Monument Area in Bangkok, Thailand as case study (irregular (non-grid) road network with high traffic congestion).
- Pomona College RAISE Project; Summer 2021 Poster [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zXCkl2yBgHi1qebSK-ckUoWIixA8NvKT/view?usp=sharing).
- Original Goals:
    1. Research methods of traffic management and control in Bangkok,
    2. Synthesize available data on Bangkok traffic (in specific areas and intersections), 
    3. Investigate potential ways to alleviate traffic; experiment with different traffic light configurations and levels of human interaction in semi-autonomous systems.
- Updated Short-term goals
    - Improve lane change accuracy and behavior.
    - Be able to set specific paths for cars individually to more accurately simulate rush hour traffic flow. 
    - Analyze the success rate of cars taking specific routes through the road network under different conditions to get an idea of the effectiveness of the implemented lane changing algorithm.
    - Transfer code to platform with better UI and start working on front-end development.
- Updated Long-term goals
    - Test software with larger scale road networks (full cities and towns) and evaluate efficiency of back-end implementations.
    - Make the software field testable by police officers.
    - Research traffic measurement metrics and add them to the software to evaluate the efficiency of different methods of traffic control and traffic light configuration.
    - Implement different algorithms for cars and observe how they interact. Evaluate how different driving behavior affects trafficby vary proportions of cars with respective driving behaviors and tendencies.
    - Potential uses of software in urban planning, simulating new road networks and their respective traffic levels under different conditions before they're built, etc.

### PeNNdulum: A Neural Networks-Physics Project [[github]](https://gthampak.github.io/physinet.io/) *(Fall 2021)* 
- Trained Fully Connected, Long Short-term Memory Recurrent, Echo State, and Lagrangian Neural Networks’ and compared their effectiveness in forecasting double pendulum motion (a chaotic system).
- Used PyTorch for baseline models, and modeled Echo State and Langragian Networks based on example models (linked on project webpage).
- The goal is explore if the LNN is capable of outperforming a more general-purpose neural network that is highly successful at predicting the behavior of chaotic systems, Reservoir Computing (RC), the long-short term memory neural network (LSTM), which is excellent at forecasting sequential tasks, as well as a baseline fully-connected neural network model (FC).
- LNN is clearly the best model as it preserves the total energy of the system, resulting in realistic path predictions. ESN and LSTM predictions appear random with extreme discontinuity with respect to laws of physics between timesteps. The baseline model did not capture any information on system dynamics and predicted one position for all time steps to minimize error.
- I was responsible for the write-up and contributed to designing and training each neural network.

### Covid Mirrors Geography [[github]](https://github.com/gthampak/covid-mirrors-geography) *(Fall 2021)* 
- Inspired by [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature07331) *Genes Mirror Geography Within Europe* published on Nature. 
- We wanted to investigate the similarities and differences countries in similar situations during the pandemic.
- We used clustering and PCA which makes our methods generalizable to other datasets since we do not have to tune a model or perform
large amounts of wrangling to use our analysis on related data.
Performed Principal Component Analysis (machine learning) on OWID covid dataset and applied k-means clustering over 700+ days.
An interesting finding from our analysis is that countries in the same region tend to be clustered together daily. We suspected that this was because many identifier variables of these countries (continent, etc.) may be similar so there were clustered together. However, when we removed these variables and only hand-picked those that are purely pandemic related and are less likely to identify the regions of the countries, we got very similar clusters from the principal components, which is extremely interesting. This result was animated onto a world map.

### UCLA DATAFEST *(Springs)* 
- (Click on year to access respective github repositories)
- [2022:]((https://github.com/tyxiang0530/FreeGourds2022)) Investigated Player Engagement in Yale Med’s School’s Elm City Stories Game
    - [Google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XB1prYkBzXWnu-iwuiSdd577bAZ8rVAQ) with detailed notes, presentation, presentation outline, etc.
    - Worked with over 2 million data points of unpublished data on Elm City Stories, a game designed by Yale's play2Prevent Lab.
    - I was responsible for data wrangling, data cleaning and manipulation, data analysis and data visualizations.
    - We concluded that the outcome variable ("S5 scores" from surveys conducted to evaluate effectiveness of game in preventing feelings towards drug use) is highly flawed and were not collected consistently enough to inform us of the true effectiveness of the game. This conclusion is supported by a paper later published on the game's data which had much more comprehensive and fine-grained metrics through more detailed surveys to evaluate the effcetiveness of the game as well.
    - However, we did see some promising trends that the game boost confidence in making correct decisions in real life situations involving drugs for players with high engagement.

- [2021:](https://github.com/Amber-Patricia-Lee/ShareThaiDatafest) Exploration, investigation, and analysis of drug-use dataset [(github)](https://github.com/Amber-Patricia-Lee/ShareThaiDatafest)
    -  [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/search?q=sharethai) with final presentation slides, brief summary of findings, and presentation video.
    -   Worked with a U.S. 2018 Drug-use dataset. 
    -   I was responsible to exploratory data exploration and data visualization and building logistic regression models for predicting use of opiods inluding variable selection, feature engineering, cross validating, and more.
    -   One interesting (but incomplete, because we ran out of time) finding from this project was the correlation between sentiment and valence scores of tweets in different states and drug use.
    -   This experience was especially unique due to our teams' circumstances; it was a completely remote datathon in the middle of the pandemic. We did not achieve as much as we thought we would. Due to the pandemic, we had members working from three different countries in four different time zones, which led to challenges in communication and continuation. We learned a lot from this and by the end of the weekend wrote much more detailed notes and set clear goals for others to follow.

- [2020:](https://github.com/tyxiang0530/Datafest---2020) Effect of the Covid-19 Pandemic on Sentiment Scores of Popular Videos on Youtube (in the U.S., U.K., India, Australia, Canada) [(github)](https://github.com/tyxiang0530/Datafest---2020)
    - Award: UCLA DataFest Judges’ Award: Best Data Collection
    - [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1MyY3tUPC5bkpHQG8ajxyuiQ8xhpZGkkl) with brief final report, final data analysis reports, data visualizations, data, and final video.
    - We used data from the John Hopkins Covid dataset in mid March 2020, used Youtube API to access transcripts of popular youtube videos and performed sentiment analysis on them.
    - This was a unique experience as we were not given a dataset at all and had two weeks to work on the project as opposed to one weekend.
    - I was in charge of project brainstorming, data cleaning, wranggling, and organization, data exploration and analysis, and data visualizations.
    - We found that in a select few categories, the proportion of popular videos with positive senitment were different before and after the Covid outbreak. However, in most categories across all countries, the sentiment scores of popular videos remained the same. We speculate that this lack of difference may be due to the relative job security of popular YouTubers, as well as the generally manufactured personality that is imprinted upon large and more ‘methodical’ YouTube channels. Despite conditions worsening, perhaps large YouTube personalities must maintain their ‘personalities’ to preserve their view count and income.

### Genetics (Wet Lab) and Database Research Assistantship, Pomona College *(Spring 2020)*
- Title: Observing E. Coli Genetics in Relation to Biofilm Formation of Wild-Type and Mutant E. Coli Using Dictyostelium
- Identified genes responsible for formation and characteristics of bacterial biofilms through phagocytosis of Dictyostelium.
- I was responsible for maintaining Dictyostelium cultures and running Dictyostelium - E. Coli phagocytosis trials from start to finish. 
- I created an started a database for past and new data (images and all relevant variables and information) that is much easier to access and look through. While this project has been ongoing for a while, collected data was somewhat scattered so the database makes it easier for future students and/or collaborators of the research project to get caught up and understand where the project is at.
- I ran over 300 successful E Coli.-Dictyostelium petri dish trials, and spent the rest of my time setting up the database and writing documentation for how to access it.
